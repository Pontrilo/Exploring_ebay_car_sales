# Exploring_ebay_car_sales

Guided project to explore car sales on Ebay

We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points that was prepared by Dataquest including simulating a less-cleaned version of the data.

The aim of this project is to clean and analyse the used car listings data. Tidying the dataframes, replacing poor values and manipulating columns to study the trends the data shows.

This project is based on the guided project by Dataquest and used as a learning tool project.

The files in the repository are as follows:
